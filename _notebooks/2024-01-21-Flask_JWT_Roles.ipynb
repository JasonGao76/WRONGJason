    "Data models define a structure of data as well as the relationship between different parts and elements of the data. You can name your single data model class User. This name can be anything you want. The name can be fixed or flexible depending on the requirments of what is being applied to.\n",

    "Flexible data model property names are dynamic and are best for when your data structures change over time. This means it is easier to adapt and change. It gives it less security and might require more effort for validation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Fixed data model property names are often explicitly defined and remain constant. They are normally consistent and stable which is well suited for when you have a clear data requirment. They are less adaptable to changes in data requirments.\n",
    "Examples: User.id, User.username, User.password, User.email\n",
    "\n",
    "Roles and User Roles: When you add a roles and user roles data models to your function, you add a form of role based authentification which means the original user function must also define a roles relationship property. This makes your data models more manegable by giving it a system that is organized by its roles."
